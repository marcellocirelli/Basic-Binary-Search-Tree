# Basic Binary Search Tree (Java CLI)

A **Java command-line program** that implements a basic **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with interactive menu options.

This project was created as an academic exercise to demonstrate understanding of tree-based data structures, traversal logic, and console-driven program flow.

## Overview

The program allows users to build and interact with a binary search tree through a text-based menu.  
Users can insert values into the tree and perform various operations to explore and manipulate the structure.

The BST logic is implemented using a simple `Node` class with left and right child references.

## Features

- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Binary Search Tree implementation
- Dynamic insertion of integer values
- Menu-driven user interaction
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Clear separation between tree logic and user input

## Implementation Details

- Written entirely in **Java**
- Uses an inner `Node` class containing:
  - `int value`
  - `Node left`
  - `Node right`
- Tree operations are handled procedurally within the main program
- Console input handled via `Scanner`

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- Data structures (Binary Search Tree)
- CLI-based interaction
- Control flow and input handling

## Purpose

This project demonstrates:
- Understanding of tree data structures
- BST insertion and navigation logic
- Java fundamentals for algorithmic problems
- Console-based program design

## Notes

This project was created for academic practice
